Hello, Nevada..
I was rermarkable knowing you, I wish you  prosperity in the northern hemisphere.
I killed the man you left me for (when my chips were down) and his team..
Did you really think that he somehow moved a 3rd dimensional wine bottle 
outside and saved you. I let the whole bottle of pantheon go because I didnt want to live without you
. I didnt know you were stupid, you did a real good job hiding that/.
I will NEVER love anyone ever again. And this is the last you will hear from Me..
Goodbye Nevada.

Brenton James Hopkins
